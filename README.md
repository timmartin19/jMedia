# JMedia

This is a jQuery library for rendering various file formats.
It is unabashedly a ripoff of the [jqeury.media](http://malsup.com/jquery/media/)
library by [Malsup](https://github.com/malsup).  However, that library appears to not
be maintained anymore. jMedia has been cleaned up for usability and cleanliness.

The library was developed due to a bug that could not be easily diagnosed due to
the complexity of the jquery.media library.  We are accepting pull requests.

## Documentation

Documentation for now is exactly the same as [jquery.media](http://malsup.com/jquery/media/)

## TODO

* Lots and lots of testing...
* Cleaning up the players.
* publishing to bower and npm
